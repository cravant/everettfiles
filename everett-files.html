                    Operation EVERETT represents one of the most significant counterintelligence investigations 
                    undertaken by the Joseph Coolidge Agency in the past decade. The case centers on Dr. Michael 
                    James Everett, a former NSA contractor with access to highly classified signals intelligence 
                    programs, who is suspected of unauthorized data exfiltration, espionage, and potential 
                    collaboration with foreign intelligence services.
                </p>
                <p class="dossier-text">
                    Initial detection occurred on 03 March 2025 when NSA security systems flagged anomalous 
                    network activity originating from Everett's workstation at Fort Meade. Subsequent forensic 
                    analysis revealed systematic unauthorized access to classified databases, encrypted file 
                    transfers to external servers, and communications with individuals later identified as 
                    foreign intelligence operatives.

                <p class="dossier-text">
                    The scope and sensitivity of potentially compromised information necessitates continued 
                    investigation with maximum operational security. This dossier contains all available 
                    intelligence, surveillance evidence, and recovered communications related to Subject EVERETT.

                <p class="dossier-text">
                    Michael Everett was born in Columbus, Ohio, to middle-class parents with no known connections 
                    to foreign governments or intelligence services. He demonstrated exceptional aptitude in 
                    mathematics and computer science from an early age, graduating summa cum laude from MIT in 
                    2006 with degrees in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.
                </p>
                <p class="dossier-text">
                    Following graduate studies at Stanford University, where he earned a Ph.D. in Cryptography 
                    in 2011, Everett was recruited directly into the intelligence community. He initially worked 
                    as a civilian employee at NSA's Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services division before 
                    transitioning to contractor status with Quantum Defense Solutions in 2019.

                <p class="dossier-text">
                    Throughout his career, Everett maintained TS/SCI clearance and access to some of the nation's 
                    most sensitive signals intelligence programs. His work focused on developing algorithms for 
                    breaking encrypted communications and analyzing foreign cryptographic systems. Performance 
                    reviews consistently rated him as exceptional, with no prior security incidents or concerns.

                        I have the materials we discussed. The package is larger than expected - approximately 
                        800GB compressed. Transfer will require secure channel and may take several sessions 
                        to complete without detection.

                        Regarding compensation: I need assurances before proceeding further. The risk profile 
                        has changed significantly since Prague. We should discuss terms in person.
