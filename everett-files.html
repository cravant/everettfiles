                    Everette Shupe is an 18-year-old student at All Saints Episcopal School in Tyler, Texas. He is physically described as brown-haired with a lanky build. Academic performance was adequate, though his school record reflects repeated disciplinary action for defiance, rule violations, and confrontational behavior. Shupe was highly controlled in conduct and visibly noncompliant rather than disruptive or impulsive.
                </p>
                <p class="dossier-text">
                    Shupe maintained an ongoing and widely observed relationship with Dr. Lambert, a science instructor at the school. Shupe was aware that Lambert engaged in activities outside his professional role and continued the association despite this knowledge. The relationship was not concealed and persisted despite administrative concern, indicating deliberate participation.
                </p>
                <p class="dossier-text">
                    Shupe knowingly associated with criminal actors outside the school environment. He maintained an intimate relationship with an individual known as “Chanelo,” despite awareness of narcotics involvement. Through this connection, Shupe had direct contact with Joel, also known as “Riley Joel,” a confirmed member of a hardened criminal organization. These associations occurred with prior knowledge and without evidence of coercion.

                        I have the materials we discussed. The package is larger than expected - approximately 
                        800GB compressed. Transfer will require secure channel and may take several sessions 
                        to complete without detection.

                        Regarding compensation: I need assurances before proceeding further. The risk profile 
                        has changed significantly since Prague. We should discuss terms in person.
